                I write JavaScript code for my employeer.
                    I love JavaScript and its younger brother TypeScript and, in the end, that technology is what
                    allowed me to move 14 thousand kilometers, across the ocean and start a new life with my wife here
                    in Germany. So I have only nice things to say about it.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately it is also true that nowadays it seems impossible to do anything on the web without
                    JavaScript. Not only that but websites rely on fast internet connections for everything. Have you
                    ever ride a train and you saw the 3G indication on your mobile phone (or even worse, the dreadful
                    "E" indicator) and thought "ok there goes my browsing"? Why is that the case. Some years ago 3G was
                    a more than capable connection, but now it feels that unless you are on 4G or 5G, the internet is
                    just plain useless.</p>

                <p>I create this blog precisely because of that, as my own capsule of minimalism in a world of social
                    media feeds and algorithmic content distribution. This blog should be readable on a very bad
                    internet connection and without JavaScript. Even if you block CSS files, the content itself should
                    be perfectly readable</p>
            <p>In a world obsessed with JavaScript frameworks, I've found that plain HTML still delivers the best user experience for content-focused websites. Here's why:</p>
            
            <p>First, <strong>performance</strong>. A static HTML page loads instantly. No JavaScript bundle to download, no virtual DOM to render, no hydration step. Just pure, immediate content.</p>
            
            <p>Second, <strong>accessibility</strong>. Semantic HTML works with screen readers out of the box. No ARIA attributes needed, no complex state management to break keyboard navigation.</p>
            
            <p>Third, <strong>longevity</strong>. HTML from 1995 still renders perfectly today. Can we say the same about React components from 2015?</p>
            
            <p>The web was built for documents. Sometimes, that's exactly what we need.</p>
            
            <h3>The Performance Advantage</h3>
            <p>When I look at modern websites, I'm often shocked by their loading times. A simple blog post that should be a few kilobytes becomes megabytes of JavaScript. Users on slow connections suffer, mobile users drain their batteries, and search engines penalize the site.</p>
            
            <p>Plain HTML loads in milliseconds. There's no "time to interactive" because it's interactive immediately. There's no layout shift because the content is there from the start.</p>
            
            <h3>Future-Proofing</h3>
            <p>Frameworks come and go. Angular gave way to React, which is now competing with Vue, Svelte, and countless others. But HTML? HTML is eternal.</p>
            
            <p>The first website, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, still works perfectly in modern browsers. That's 30+ years of backward compatibility. Can your React app from 2018 run without updates today?</p>
            
            <h3>The Web Components Experiment</h3>
            <p>I initially built this blog with web components, thinking they'd provide the best of both worlds: modularity without frameworks. I was wrong.</p>
            
            <p>The fundamental problem: <strong>web components require JavaScript to function at all</strong>. This breaks the entire "plain HTML" philosophy. If you need JavaScript anyway, why not use React?</p>
            
            <h4>What I Learned</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web components aren't progressive enhancement</strong> - They're JavaScript dependencies</li>
                <li><strong>They don't add value over plain HTML</strong> - Just duplicate existing structure</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance overhead</strong> - Two places to update the same content</li>
                <li><strong>No actual benefits</strong> - Same JS dependency as frameworks, less ecosystem support</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>So I removed them entirely. This blog is now 100% plain HTML and CSS. No JavaScript. No components. No build step. Just content that works everywhere, instantly.</p>
            
            <p>The key insight: <strong>Don't add technology unless it solves a real problem</strong>. Web components solved a problem I didn't actually have.</p>
            
            <h3>Corollary: The Art of Minimal CSS</h3>
            <p>Plain HTML is only half the story. The styling philosophy matters just as much.</p>
            
            <p>After years of wrestling with CSS frameworks, I've discovered the power of constraint. Less code, fewer bugs, faster loading. My current CSS philosophy:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>System fonts only</strong> - No web fonts to download</li>
                <li><strong>No animations unless essential</strong> - Performance over flashiness</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive by default</strong> - Mobile-first design</li>
                <li><strong>Dark mode as a bonus</strong> - Not a requirement</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Why System Fonts Win</h4>
            <p>Custom fonts are beautiful, but they come with a cost. Each font file is additional bandwidth, and users see a flash of invisible text while fonts load. System fonts are optimized for the user's device and load instantly.</p>
            
            <p>More importantly, system fonts respect user preferences. If someone has configured their system for better readability, custom fonts often override these settings.</p>
            
            <h4>The Animation Trap</h4>
            <p>CSS animations can enhance user experience, but they're often overused. Every animation is JavaScript in disguise - it triggers repaints and consumes CPU cycles.</p>
            
            <p>I use animations only when they provide clear user value: indicating loading states, showing relationships between elements, or providing feedback for user actions.</p>
            
            <h4>Responsive by Design</h4>
            <p>Instead of adding responsive breakpoints after the fact, I design mobile-first. Every element works on small screens by default. Desktop layouts are enhancements, not requirements.</p>
            
            <p>The result? A 2KB stylesheet that works everywhere and loads instantly.</p>
