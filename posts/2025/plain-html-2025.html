            I write JavaScript code for my employer. I love the JavaScript
            ecosystem (TypeScript, the frameworks, you name it). JS is the
            technology that allowed me to move 14,000 kilometers away from home
            together with my wife, across the ocean from Argentina to Germany.

            When I started learning to code in high school many years ago,
            programming a computer meant writing magic words in English (at the
            time, we used Turbo Pascal) and reading its output on a terminal. It
            was also very obscurem, you couldn't really see much of what your
            program was doing unless you took the time to actually build a UI
            for it, which was very cumbersome.
          </p>
          <p>
            But one day, another teacher from a completely unrelated course
            started teaching us how to create websites. I was immediately
            hooked. Nevertheless, I didn't properly learn JS until much later in
            my career, when I started creating websites for a number of clients.

            JS is versatile. But that versatility makes it very much
            inescapable. To get a feeling for what I mean, try disabling it for
            a few minutes. You'll find out very quickly that most of the sites
            you visit won't work without it, or at least their functionality
            will be severely impacted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10597">study</a> I read
            about this mentioned that “...43% of pages were very likely to be
            completely working with JavaScript disabled and that more than 67%
            were likely to be usable enough.” This doesn't sound so bad, but
            when you realize that most people only visit their social media
            platform of choice, the picture changes quite a lot.
          </p>

            Not only that, but have you ever been on a train, seen the 3G
            indicator on your mobile phone (or even worse, the dreadful E), and
            thought, "There goes my browsing"? Why is that the case? A 3G
            connection used to be very capable, but now it feels like unless
            you're on 4G or 5G, the internet is just plain useless.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created this blog precisely because of that — as my own capsule of
            minimalism in a world of social media feeds and algorithmic content
            distribution. This blog should be readable on a very bad internet
            connection and without JavaScript. Even if you block CSS files, the
            content itself should remain perfectly readable.
          </p>

            In a world obsessed with JavaScript frameworks, I've found that
            plain HTML still delivers a great user experience for
            content-focused websites. For a number of reasons:
          </p>
          <p>
            First, <strong>performance</strong>. A static HTML page loads
            instantly. No JavaScript bundle to download, no virtual DOM to
            render, no hydration step — just pure, immediate content. When I
            look at modern websites, I'm often shocked by their loading times. A
            simple blog post that should be a few kilobytes becomes megabytes of
            JavaScript. Users on slow connections suffer, mobile users drain
            their batteries, and search engines penalize the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, <strong>accessibility</strong>. Semantic HTML works with
            screen readers out of the box. No ARIA attributes needed, no complex
            state management to break keyboard navigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Third, <strong>longevity</strong>. HTML from 1995 still renders
            perfectly today. Can we say the same about React components from
            2015?
          </p>

          <p>
            The web was built for documents. Sometimes, that's exactly what we
            need. Frameworks come and go. Angular gave way to React, which now
            competes with Vue, Svelte, and countless others. HTML is here to
            stay.
