This is your first blog post! The system automatically reads files from the `posts` folder and displays them on the texts page.

## How it works

- Add `.md` or `.txt` files to the `posts` folder
- The first line starting with `#` becomes the title
- Posts are automatically sorted by date (newest first)
- Each post gets its own page at `/texts/filename`

## Markdown Support

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and different heading levels:

### This is a subheading

Write your content naturally. The system supports basic markdown formatting like:

- **Bold text** with `**text**`
- *Italic text* with `*text*`
- Headings with `#`, `##`, `###`

Just save your files and they'll automatically appear on the texts page!

## Getting Started

To add a new post:
1. Create a new `.md` or `.txt` file in the `posts` folder
2. Start with a `#` heading for the title
3. Write your content
4. Save the file - it will automatically appear on the texts page

That's it! No need to update any code or configuration.
